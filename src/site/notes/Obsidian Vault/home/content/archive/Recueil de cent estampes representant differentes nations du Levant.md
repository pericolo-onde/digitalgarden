"Recueil de cent estampes representant differentes nations du Levant" is a work published between 1712 and 1713 by Jacques Le Hay under the authority of Charles de Ferriol, French ambassador to Constantinople. It contains prints engraved after the paintings of Jean-Baptiste Vanmour, representing the costumes and daily life of various nations of the Levant (Turks, Greeks, Jews, Persians, etc.). This collection was very influential, contributing to the vogue of turcerie in Europe.
